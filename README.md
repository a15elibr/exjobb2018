The 'official' repo for my bachelor thesis project, at Högskolan i Skövde, 2018.

### A quick introduction
This project introduces <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/a15elibr/exjobb2018/master/testning/migwiz1/public/images/mini.png" width="15"> **MigWiz**, a wizard for database migration for Multi-site CMS's. Specifically, this wizard migrates WordPress applications to Keystone JS. The full written report for this project can be found at http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:his:diva-15549.

### Background
Multi-site applications in WordPress are currently experiencing performance issues connected to a high number of users or subdomains. This project theorizes that these performance issues originates from the limitations of SQL-databases, and therefor, can be solved by migrating to another database system. Specifically, the NoSQL database MongoDB is proposed as a solution, given its' advantages over MySQL regarding certain functionalities, such as handling large number of uses and massive data sets. To enable users without prior technological skills to migrate their WordPress applications to the more new CMS-system Keystone JS, a migration tool is proposed: <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/a15elibr/exjobb2018/master/testning/migwiz1/public/images/mini.png" width="15"> **MigWiz**.
